# Chat-Room-Client-Server-App

This application simulates a messaging application with multiple chat rooms using a multi-threaded server that is readily hostable on the web. The client may open the user interface by running the Client.py file using a Python IDE with tkinter installed. The server allows for multiple users to do multiple transactions across the communication socket by implementing a mutex-based resource protection model for each client.
